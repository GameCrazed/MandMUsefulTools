This is a small, very messily written but (to my knowledge) entirely functional single-html file website that has a few tools to help when playing and running Mutants and Masterminds 3E.

Part of the challenge of this little project was keeping everything in one simple html file that my DM and other players could just download and run, as such I've no current plans to separate it all out to be unhinged.

All game logic used comes from the Mutants and Masterminds 3rd edition Deluxe Edition Handbook (2013)

Currently the tools included in the website are:
- A Degrees of Success/Failure Calculator
- A Throwing Distance Calculator (accepting both lbs, kg, and mass rank for object weight)
- The Measurements Table (with the ability to toggle between imperial & metric)
- The Advantages List (with the ability to search & filter according to selected advantages)
- A Conditions page (which allows for the tracking of conditions across multiple creatures, including injuries)
- A Variable Powers Manager (a simple page to allow for the easy tracking of which powers are currently active. Allows for exporting & importing of powers)

Feel free to download and use. Also feel free to suggest additions and report issues. Who knows, I may even fix them!
